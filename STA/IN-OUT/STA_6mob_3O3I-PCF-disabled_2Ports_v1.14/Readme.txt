"STA_6mob_3O3I-PCF-disabled_2Ports_v1.14" Arduino Readme file

This stems from "STA_6mob_8O8I_2Ports_v1.13"
This interworks with "Control_3P.v1" android app I guess.

In this version:

1) just disabling PCF (while keeping the code) thus degrading the panel to 5O5I - I'm interestd in this version because I usually take the last one I worked on which should be the cleaner.
