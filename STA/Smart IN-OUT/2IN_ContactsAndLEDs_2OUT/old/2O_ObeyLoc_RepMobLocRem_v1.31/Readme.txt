--This arduino folder interworks with "" (or even some previous versions) arduino folder.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.8"
--Mobile apps do not control (for this version) this panel but are able to ask to get a report since what's really interesting is the state of this panel's relays (not the ordering panel).
