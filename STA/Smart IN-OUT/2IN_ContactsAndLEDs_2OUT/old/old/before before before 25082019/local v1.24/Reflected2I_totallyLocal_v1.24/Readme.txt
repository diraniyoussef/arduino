Reflected2I_totallyLocal_v1.24

*This version stems from the series of "Reflected2I_v1.23" in the Backup file.
*This arduino folder interworks with "Reflector2O_local_v1.24" arduino folder.
*Mobile apps do not control this panel but may ask to get a report. The mobile app version is "Out3P_Ref1P-2In.v3"
*This is associated with DesignSpark file "Reflected_2In".

Note: Perhaps there are some old important notes in previous Readme files that are worth of being checked.

***Feature
--It will inform locally a certain local panel, and it will receive report requests from locally connected mobile apps. Has nothing related to internet.
In order to do that I made some minor changes in the main sketch file and in connectionSetup() in ConnectionSetup.h file.
