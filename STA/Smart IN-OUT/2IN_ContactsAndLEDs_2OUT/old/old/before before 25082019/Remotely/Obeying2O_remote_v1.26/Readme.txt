Obeying2O_remote_v1.26 - Arduino

--This version stems from "Obeying2O_remote_v1.25".
--This arduino folder interworks with "Ordering2I_mainlyRemote_v1.26" arduino folder.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.6"
--Mobile apps do not control (for this version) this panel but are able to ask to get a report since what's really interesting is the state of this panel's relays (not the ordering panel).
--This is associated with DesignSpark file "Obeying_B1_v1.5.pcb" in folder "Reflector_2Relays".

***Motivation of this version 
--allow the user to set the panel's network configuration through a special pin. Check Ordering2I_mainlyRemote_v1.26. It's the same idea.
