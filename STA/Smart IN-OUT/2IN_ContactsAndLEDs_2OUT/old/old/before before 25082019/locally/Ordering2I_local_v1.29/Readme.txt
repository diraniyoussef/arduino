--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.6"
--This interworks with Design Spark : B1_v1.?? in folder Ordering_2In. It also interworks with AutoReflected_2In\B1_v1.??
--This interworks with Android Out3P_Ref1P-2In.v3.4
--This panel is more compatible with informing buttons not contacts, so it has limited capabilities in terms of localWiFi and remote connection and so on.
