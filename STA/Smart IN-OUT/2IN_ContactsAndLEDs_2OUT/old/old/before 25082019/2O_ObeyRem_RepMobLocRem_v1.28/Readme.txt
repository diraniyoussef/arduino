2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.28 - Arduino

--This version stems from "2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.27".
--This arduino folder interworks with "Ordering2I_mainlyRemote_v1.28" arduino folder.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.6"
--Mobile apps do not control (for this version) this panel but are able to ask to get a report since what's really interesting is the state of this panel's relays (not the ordering panel).
--This is associated with DesignSpark file "Obeying_B1_v1.9.pcb" in folder "Reflector_2Relays".

***Motivation of this version 
-- Setting back the D5 LED to be ON when D5 pin is HIGH, but this is made through current structure (simply by changing "asConsidered" stuff, i.e. getInPinStateAsConsidered and setOutPinStateAsConsidered)
