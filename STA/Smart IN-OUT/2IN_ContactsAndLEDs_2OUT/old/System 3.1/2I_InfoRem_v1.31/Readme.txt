2I_InfoRem_v1.31  - Arduino

--This version stems from "2I_InfoRem_v1.30"
--This arduino folder interworks with "2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.30" or even some previous versions arduino folder.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.8"
--This interworks with Design Spark : It also interworks with AutoReflected_2In\B1_v2.2 (Actually, the PCB I designed still considers the notifier pin (D8) parallel to its LED (I mean not setPinAsOpposite).)
