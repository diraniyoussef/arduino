2I_InfoRem_v1.32  - Arduino

--This version stems from "2I_InfoRem_v1.31"
--This arduino folder interworks with "2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.30" or even some previous versions arduino folder. I haven't put 2I_InfoRem_v1.32in the same folder as 2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.30 because I just wanted to introduce the feature of this version, not really am I interested in interworking with another Arduino.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.6"
--This interworks with Design Spark : It also interworks with AutoReflected_2In\B1_v2.3 

THIS IS A WORKING VERSION

***Motivation behind this version
--the notifier pin (D8) is now opposite to its LED
--The RST pin will be connected to D7 instead of D9 just to free the serial diagnosis potentiality.
