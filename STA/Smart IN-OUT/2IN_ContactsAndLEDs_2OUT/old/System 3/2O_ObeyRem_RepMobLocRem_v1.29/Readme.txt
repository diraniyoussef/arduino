--This version stems from "2O_ObeyRem_RepMobLocRem_v1.28".
--This arduino folder interworks with "2I_InfoRem_v1.30" arduino folder.
--This interworks with eclipse intermediate code "ControlLinker_v0.8"
--Mobile apps do not control (for this version) this panel but are able to ask to get a report since what's really interesting is the state of this panel's relays (not the ordering panel).
--This is associated with DesignSpark file ">= Obeying_B1_v1.9.pcb" in folder "Reflector_2Relays".
